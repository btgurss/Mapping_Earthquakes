# Mapping_Earthquakes

##Purpose/Overview
In this challenge I was tasked with creating a webpage that uses maps to portray information.  This particular webpage shows earthquakes within the last 7 days as well as the major fault lines around the world.  The ultimate goal would be to see how much of a relationship these two data points have.  To make the map more user friendly I did the following things:
- Gave three options for the base layer.  The user can see street views, satellite street views, or views in dark mode.
- The earthquake locations are marked with circles that are different colors and sizes based on the magnitude of the earthquake
- Each location marker will tell the user the magnitude and location of the earthquake at that location
- The user can overlay the map with three different options.  They may choose to show all earthquakes, only the major earthquakes (over 4.5), and/or choose to show the fault lines
